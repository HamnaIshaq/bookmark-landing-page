## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- SCSS
- Parcel
- JS

### What I learned

- I learned more about how the @use and @forward rules in SCSS.
- I leaned that pseudo-elements cannot be used with image elements.
- I am trying to learn about 7-1 SCSS architecture and get more comfortable in dividing my styles

### Useful resources

- [Stop using @import with Sass | @use and @forward explained by Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR-a8upNjJ0) - This helped me learn exactly what @use and @forward are and how to use them in SCSS. I would highly recommend Kevin Powell youtube channel if you want to learn the hows of CSS.
- [Before and After pseudo elements explained - part one: how they work by Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGiirUiWslI) - This video helped me learn that pseudo-elements are elements that are inserted before (using ::before) and after (using ::after) the actual content. This is why they do not work on images as images do not fit into the normal CSS content model.
- [Four Card Feature Section - Design to HTML/CSS by Florin Pop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcSUEo0P0GU&t=2012s) - This helped me in giving top spacing to the cards very easily.
- [How To - Change Placeholder Color by w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_placeholder.asp) - This helped me in learning how to change color for input placeholders.
- [Accordion - Bootstrap 5.0 Official Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/accordion/) - I used this to get an idea of how the accordion will function. I also tried to use the same class names used here as I had difficulty coming up with them on my own.
